# code_challenge

This problem was presented to me as an exercise for employment.  The problem was stated as "Write some code that will evaluate a poker hand and determine its rank."

The Card class creates the card.  The Deck class uses the card class and iterates over it to create a deck of 52 card with no duplicates and the correct suit structure.

I did write a test for the creation of the deck and I am this is a work in progress.
